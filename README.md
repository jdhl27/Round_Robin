# Round Robin
Round-robin is a method of selecting all the abstracts in a group evenly and in a rational order, usually starting with the first item in the list all the way to the last and starting over from the first item. The name of the algorithm comes from the Round-Robin principle known from other fields, where each person takes a part of something shared in quantities, that is, "takes turns". In computational operations, a method to execute different processes concurrently, for the equitable use of equipment resources, is by limiting each process to a small period (quantum), and then suspending this process to give another process an opportunity and so on. . This is commonly referred to as Round-Robin Planning.
